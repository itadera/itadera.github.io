            <h3>Motion Priority Optimization for Cooperative Tele-Recovery</h3>
            <p>(Description)<br>
              The escalating utilization of industrial robots at manufacturing sites has been instrumental in mitigating human workload. Nevertheless, the challenge persists in achieving effective human-robot collaboration/cooperation where human workers and robots share a workspace for collaborative tasks. In the event of an industrial robot encountering a failure, it necessitates the suspension of the corresponding factory cell for safe recovery. Given the limited capacity of pre-programmed robots to rectify such failures, human intervention becomes imperative, requiring entry into the robot workspace to address the dropped object while the robot system is halted. This non-continuous manufacturing process results in productivity loss. Robotic teleoperation has emerged as a promising technology enabling human workers to undertake high-risk tasks remotely and safely. Our study advocates for the incorporation of robotic teleoperation in the recovery process during manufacturing failure scenarios, which is referred to as "Cooperative Tele-Recovery". Our proposed approach involves the formulation of priority rules designed to facilitate collision avoidance between manufacturing and recovery robots. This, in turn, ensures a continuous manufacturing process with minimal production loss within a configurable risk limitation.
